# Fourier Transformation
This is another one of my favourite weekend project I did. My attempt on Fourier transformation.

Try it out here: https://murlidharvarma.github.io/fourier-transformation

When I read about Fourier Transforms, I found it very intriguing. Thanks to awesome explaination by Mathologer, The Coding Train and 3 Blue 1 Brown. This concept gave me an idea to gift my wife on our anniversary and hence it kept me going through the complexity.

Also wanted to mention this wonderful article that helps build an intuition on this concept very easily. Enjoy.
